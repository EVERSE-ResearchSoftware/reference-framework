# 3 Four Views

The EVERSE reference framework recognises that research software quality cannot be assessed through a single, universal approach. Different stakeholders, contexts, and purposes require tailored perspectives on what constitutes quality and excellence in research software. To address this diversity, the framework provides four complementary views that help users navigate and apply quality considerations appropriate to their specific situation.

These four views are:

- **Three-Tiers View**: Recognises that different types of research software---from personal analysis scripts to broadly-used research infrastructure---have distinct quality requirements and stakeholder needs
- **Software Lifecycle View**: Acknowledges that quality considerations vary depending on where software sits in its development and maintenance lifecycle
- **Personas View**: Understands that different roles in the research ecosystem (researchers who code, RSEs, principal investigators, policy makers, trainers) have varying priorities and responsibilities regarding software quality
- **Science Clusters View**: Recognises that different research domains and communities have established practices, standards, and cultural approaches that influence how software quality is understood and implemented

Each view offers a lens through which the core quality dimensions (Technical, FAIR, Open Source, and Sustainability) can be interpreted and prioritised. Rather than being mutually exclusive, these views are designed to work together, allowing users to consider multiple perspectives when assessing or improving research software quality. The framework's strength lies in this multi-faceted approach, enabling it to serve the diverse needs of the European research software community while maintaining coherence in its underlying principles.
